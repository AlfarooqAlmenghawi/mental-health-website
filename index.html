    Everyone just says that Depression is like having a rain cloud follow you around all the time. 
    And that You feel really sad, tired, and you don't enjoy things that you usually find fun, like playing games or hanging out with friends.
    But that's not the case. 
    It's all thanks to people around you ruining your life all the time, by doing things that are at the expense of harming your mental health and wellbeing.
    This can include ignoring you, disrespecting you, and just overall making your life miserable, I can't be bothered stating all the harm that people are capable of doing, because there is too much.
